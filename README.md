# Scottz0r Github IO Site

This is the code for my github profile site. "Production" code is here, in the root folder.

See src folder for source code that geneated the files here.

## Shell

The code for the shell is in /src/src (awesome path). See [console-sim.ts](src/src/console-sim.ts) for the code that attempts to mimic a shell in the browser window. This simulation provides methods for reading and writing to the "shell."
